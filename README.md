Learning to use Git Hub

Hi there I'm Jane Doe
I'm new to Git Hub and I'm trying to navigate my way around the website.
Feels good to be a part of Git Hub, I've heard so much about it but didn't think I would get to use it one day. For this I thank Master Katu-One. lol.
Oops, I was supposed to write this first here, but I edited my master branch instead. Face. Palm.
